# SOC Audit Service Implementation

## Overview
The Audit Service has been refocused from simple audit trails to comprehensive SOC 1/SOC 2 audit management. This service now handles the complete lifecycle of SOC audits including planning, fieldwork, testing, findings, and reporting.

## New Entity Structure

### 1. SOCAudit Entity
The main audit entity that tracks:
- Audit types (SOC1 Type 1/2, SOC2 Type 1/2, SOC3, SOCPS)
- Audit lifecycle phases and status
- Team assignments (lead auditor, engagement partner, quality reviewer)
- CPA firm integration
- Trust Services Criteria selection
- Control framework mapping
- Budget and timeline tracking
- Quality assurance workflow

### 2. AuditFinding Entity
Manages audit findings with:
- Finding types and severity levels
- COSO framework mapping (Condition, Criteria, Cause, Effect)
- Management responses and remediation tracking
- Evidence linkage
- Prior year finding tracking
- Report inclusion management

### 3. ControlTest Entity
Tracks control testing activities:
- Test procedures and methodologies
- Sampling approaches and sizes
- Test results and exceptions
- Evidence collection
- Review and approval workflow
- Retest management
- ITGC and automated control flags

### 4. AuditProgram Entity
Defines the audit execution plan:
- Program sections and procedures
- Risk assessment integration
- Control selection criteria
- Resource allocation
- Timeline and milestones
- Prior year considerations
- Quality control checklists

## Key Features

### Audit Lifecycle Management
- **Planning Phase**: Scoping, risk assessment, control selection
- **Fieldwork Phase**: Control testing, evidence collection
- **Review Phase**: Finding identification, management discussions
- **Reporting Phase**: Draft and final report generation
- **Quality Review**: Peer review, partner sign-off

### Status Transitions
Enforced valid status transitions:
- PLANNING → IN_FIELDWORK → REVIEW → DRAFT_REPORT → FINAL_REVIEW → COMPLETED
- Support for ON_HOLD and CANCELLED states
- Automatic validation of transitions

### Metrics and Analytics
- Control testing progress tracking
- Finding severity breakdowns
- Timeline adherence monitoring
- Budget utilization analysis
- Remediation rate calculations

### Integration Points
- Client Service: Links audits to clients
- Control Service: Maps controls to test procedures
- Evidence Service: Collects and validates audit evidence
- Reporting Service: Generates SOC reports
- Workflow Service: Manages approval processes

## API Endpoints

### SOC Audits
- `POST /soc-audits` - Create new audit
- `GET /soc-audits` - List audits with filtering
- `GET /soc-audits/:id` - Get audit details
- `PUT /soc-audits/:id` - Update audit
- `PATCH /soc-audits/:id/status` - Update status
- `PATCH /soc-audits/:id/phase` - Update phase
- `GET /soc-audits/:id/metrics` - Get audit analytics
- `POST /soc-audits/:id/archive` - Archive completed audit

### Additional Endpoints (To Be Implemented)
- Audit Findings CRUD
- Control Tests CRUD
- Audit Programs CRUD
- Evidence linking
- Report generation

## Migration from Audit Trail
The existing audit trail functionality remains intact in the `audit-trail` module. This can be used for:
- System activity logging
- User action tracking
- Change history
- Compliance logging

The new SOC audit functionality is completely separate and focused on managing actual SOC compliance audits.

## Next Steps
1. Implement Kafka event publishing for audit lifecycle events
2. Add Kong authentication guards
3. Create audit finding and control test services
4. Build audit program workflow engine
5. Integrate with Evidence Service for automated collection
6. Connect to Reporting Service for SOC report generation

## Database Configuration
The service expects a PostgreSQL database named `soc_audit` (or configured via environment variables). All entities use UUID primary keys and include comprehensive audit fields.
