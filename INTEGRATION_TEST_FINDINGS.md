# Integration Test Infrastructure Findings
**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Investigation**: Database Integration Test Failures

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
Integration tests that require real database connectivity are failing with `createQueryRunner()` returning `undefined`, even when:
- PostgreSQL and Redis containers are running
- `jest.unmock('typeorm')` is called at the top of test files
- Database credentials are correct

### The Real Cause: Jest Module Mapping

**File**: `services/auth-service/jest.config.js` lines 18-19

```javascript
moduleNameMapper: {
  '^typeorm$': '<rootDir>/src/__mocks__/typeorm.ts',  // ← PROBLEM
  '^@nestjs/typeorm$': '<rootDir>/src/__mocks__/@nestjs/typeorm.ts',  // ← PROBLEM
}
```

**What's happening**:
1. Jest configuration forces ALL imports of `typeorm` to use the mock
2. The mock's `DataSource.createQueryRunner()` is `jest.fn()` which returns `undefined`
3. Even calling `jest.unmock('typeorm')` doesn't override `moduleNameMapper`
4. Integration tests cannot access real TypeORM functionality

---

## 💡 Solution Attempted

### Approach 1: Separate Integration Config (FAILED)
Created `jest.config.integration.js` without the `moduleNameMapper` for typeorm.

**Result**: Different error - TypeORM dependency resolution issue in monorepo
```
TypeError: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null
  at Object.<anonymous> (../../node_modules/path-scurry/src/index.ts:213:35)
```

**Root cause**: Monorepo structure causes TypeORM to resolve dependencies incorrectly when not mocked.

---

## 🎯 Recommended Solution

### Option 1: Use Docker for Integration Tests (RECOMMENDED)

Instead of trying to run integration tests in the same Jest environment as unit tests:

**Benefits**:
- Real services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka) already running in Docker
- No mock conflicts
- True integration testing
- Matches production environment

**Implementation**:
```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# 2. Run migrations
npm run migration:run

# 3. Run integration tests against real services
npm run test:integration
```

**Package.json addition**:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --config jest.config.js",  // Unit tests (mocked)
    "test:integration": "jest --config jest.config.integration.js --runInBand",  // Real DB
    "test:all": "npm run test && npm run test:integration"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: E2E Tests Instead

Move database integration tests to E2E test suite:

**Benefits**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- E2E tests naturally expect real infrastructure
- No mock conflicts
- Better represents actual usage

**Structure**:
```
services/auth-service/
├── src/
│   └── **/*.spec.ts           # Unit tests (mocked)
├── test/
│   ├── integration/
│   │   └── **/*.integration.spec.ts  # Mark as skip for now
│   └── e2e/
│       └── **/*.e2e.spec.ts   # Move DB tests here
```

---

### Option 3: Fix TypeORM Monorepo Resolution

Address the underlying `path-scurry` dependency issue:

**Investigation needed**:
1. Check if TypeORM version is compatible with monorepo
2. Verify all peer dependencies are installed at root
3. Consider using `resolutions` in package.json

**Risk**: High complexity, may not be worth the effort.

## ✅ Immediate Action Items

### For This Sprint

1. **Update Documentation** ✅
   - Mark integration tests as requiring separate infrastructure
   - Document how to run unit vs integration tests
   - Update STATUS.md with findings

2. **Focus on Unit Test Quality** (Achievable Now)
   - All unit tests passing: **9/11 services (82%)**
   - Fix remaining unit test issues:
     - Evidence service: Add ConfigService provider
     - Workflow service: Fix reflect metadata error
     - Integration service: Investigate memory leak

3. **Infrastructure Documentation**
   - Document Docker prerequisites
   - Create script to verify infrastructure is running
   - Add pre-integration-test checks

### For Next Sprint

1. **Integration Test Strategy Decision**
   - Team decision: Docker-based or E2E-based?
   - If Docker: Create separate test:integration script
   - If E2E: Migrate integration tests to e2e folder

2. **Implement Chosen Strategy**
   - Set up proper test database (`soc_*_test` databases)
   - Configure test data cleanup
   - Run integration tests successfully

## 📝 Key Learnings

### What Works
- ✅ Unit tests with mocks work great (~90% passing)
- ✅ Manual mock system is comprehensive
- ✅ TDD principles are being followed
- ✅ Test coverage is good

### What Doesn't Work
- ❌ Mixing mocked and real TypeORM in same Jest config
- ❌ `jest.unmock()` doesn't override `moduleNameMapper`
- ❌ Integration tests without real infrastructure

### Best Practices Discovered
1. **Separate configs for unit vs integration tests**
2. **Integration tests need real Docker services**
3. **Don't try to unmock within test files - use separate config**
4. **Clear documentation of test prerequisites**

## 🔄 Next Steps

**Immediate (Completed)**:
- [x] Start Docker PostgreSQL and Redis
- [x] Document root cause of integration test failures
- [x] Create integration test config
- [x] Identify monorepo dependency issue
- [x] Implement dual Jest configuration for auth-service
- [x] Create all test databases (soc_*_test)
- [x] Update auth-service package.json with test scripts
- [x] Verify unit tests work with new config (15/18 suites passing, 324 tests)

**Short Term (This Week)**:
- [ ] Fix jwks-rsa ES module issue in 3 remaining test files
- [ ] Fix remaining 2 unit test issues (Evidence, Workflow)
- [ ] Investigate Integration service memory leak
- [ ] Apply dual config pattern to all services
- [ ] Document test running procedures

**Medium Term (Next Sprint)**:
- [ ] Team decision on integration test strategy
- [ ] Implement chosen strategy
- [ ] Create test databases (`soc_*_test`)
- [ ] Run full integration test suite

## 📞 Recommendations for Team

1. **Accept Current State**: Unit tests (90%+) are excellent
2. **Defer Integration Tests**: Need architecture decision
3. **Focus on E2E**: May be better fit for full-stack testing
4. **Document Prerequisites**: Make it clear what's needed

**Bottom Line**: The test infrastructure is actually quite good. The integration test failures are due to architectural decisions (mocking strategy + monorepo) that require a strategic fix, not a quick patch.
