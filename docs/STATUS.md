## 🚨 Critical Issues

### Critical (Week 1) ⭐ BLOCKERS
1. **Auth Service Jest Configuration** - HIGHEST PRIORITY
   - 5 test suites failing due to ES module transformation
   - Blocks: auth.service.spec.ts, auth.controller.spec.ts, SSO tests
   - **File**: services/auth-service/jest.config.js
   - **Action**: Add jwks-rsa/jose to transformIgnorePatterns
   - **Impact**: Blocks Keycloak/SSO integration tests
   - **Time**: 30 minutes

2. **Auth Service Database Integration Tests**
   - 12 integration tests failing in database.integration.spec.ts
   - Query runner creation fails, test users undefined
   - **Action**: Fix test database setup with TDD approach
   - **Impact**: Blocks deployment confidence
   - **Time**: 2-3 hours

3. **Client Service Dockerfile** ✅ FIXED (Oct 6, 2025)
   - Missing .js extension in CMD
   - **Status**: Fixed in services/client-service/Dockerfile:45

### High Priority
1. **API Versioning for Kong Konnect**
   - **AUTH**: ✅ COMPLETE (10/10 controllers use /api/v1)
   - **OTHER 10 SERVICES**: ❌ 0/90+ controllers updated
   - **Action**: Update @Controller decorators using TDD approach
   - **Required**: Kong Konnect expects versioned APIs
   - **Time**: 4-6 hours per service

2. **Test Infrastructure Setup**
   - Jest config issue likely affects ALL services
   - Database integration test environment broken
   - 9 services not yet tested
   - **Action**: Systematic fix across all services
   - **Time**: 2-3 hours for full suite

### Medium Priority
1. **Service Docker Deployments**
   - Most services defined in docker-compose but not verified
   - **Action**: Build, deploy, and verify each service

2. **Integration Test Coverage**
   - Policy Service: Unit tests passing, integration tests not run
   - **Action**: Run and fix integration tests per service

## 📝 Notes

### Build Standards
- All services MUST build to `dist/main.js` (never `dist/src/main.js`)
- TypeScript files must be in subdirectories, not service root
- Docker CMD: `["node", "dist/main.js"]`

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests: Minimum 80% coverage
- Integration tests: Required for all services
- E2E tests: Required for critical user flows

### Known Limitations
- Windows environment: Use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`
- TypeORM: Requires manual test instantiation pattern
- Jest: May hang - use `--detectOpenHandles --runInBand`
