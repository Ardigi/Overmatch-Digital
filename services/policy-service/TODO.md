# Policy Service - TODO List (Updated: August 13, 2025)

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### Fixed All Compilation Issues
- [‚úì] Fixed all 279 TypeScript compilation errors
- [‚úì] Created missing interface files (automation, control-automation, cache types)
- [‚úì] Fixed all DTO type mismatches
- [‚úì] Fixed service method signatures
- [‚úì] Resolved import/export issues
- [‚úì] Fixed dependency injection with @Optional decorators
- [‚úì] Configured SecretsModule properly with forRoot()
- [‚úì] Service builds successfully with 0 errors

### Implemented Core Functionality
- [‚úì] Framework-to-framework compliance mapping
- [‚úì] Policy-to-control mapping with strength validation
- [‚úì] Compliance score calculation
- [‚úì] Policy evaluation with context hashing
- [‚úì] Bulk operations for mappings
- [‚úì] Kafka integration configured

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY (Next Steps)

### 1. Test Infrastructure Overhaul
- [ ] Convert all tests to manual instantiation pattern
- [ ] Remove Test.createTestingModule for TypeORM services
- [ ] Update mock data to match new interfaces
- [ ] Create comprehensive test fixtures
- [ ] Achieve 100% test pass rate

### 2. Complete OPA Integration
- [ ] Install and configure OPA
- [ ] Convert policies to Rego format
- [ ] Implement policy compilation endpoint
- [ ] Add real-time policy evaluation
- [ ] Create policy conflict detection

## üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhancements)

### 3. Elasticsearch Search
- [ ] Configure Elasticsearch client
- [ ] Create policy index mapping
- [ ] Index policies on create/update/delete
- [ ] Implement full-text search endpoint
- [ ] Add faceted search for controls
- [ ] Implement search result ranking

### 4. Redis Caching Layer
- [ ] Configure Redis client
- [ ] Implement policy evaluation caching
- [ ] Add control mapping cache
- [ ] Cache compliance scores
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategy

### 5. Advanced Business Logic
- [ ] Policy versioning with diff view
- [ ] Multi-stage approval workflows
- [ ] Policy templates library
- [ ] Automated compliance suggestions
- [ ] Policy effectiveness scoring

## üîµ LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

### 9. Performance
- [ ] Add Redis caching
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add pagination everywhere
- [ ] Implement lazy loading

### 10. Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Architecture diagrams
- [ ] Testing guide
- [ ] Deployment guide

| Test Pass Rate | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Update | 100% |
| API Endpoints | ‚úÖ Implemented | ‚úÖ 100% |
| Kafka Integration | ‚úÖ Configured | ‚úÖ Tested |
| OPA Integration | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Search Working | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Redis Caching | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending | ‚úÖ Complete |

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### Option 1: Fix Everything (Recommended)
1. Restore ExecutionContext system
2. Fix it to work properly
3. Fix all compilation errors
4. Fix all tests
5. Add missing features

### Option 2: Incremental Fix
1. Comment out ExecutionContext temporarily
2. Get service compiling
3. Get service starting
4. Fix tests one by one
5. Re-enable ExecutionContext later

### Option 3: Minimal Working Version
1. Strip to bare minimum
2. Get CRUD working
3. Add features incrementally
4. Add enterprise features last

**Recommendation**: Option 1 - Fix everything properly. The enterprise features are important for production readiness.

## üö® Known Issues to Avoid

1. **Don't remove ExecutionContext** - It's needed for multi-tenancy
2. **Don't use Test.createTestingModule** with TypeORM - Use manual instantiation
3. **Don't add more scaffolding** - Fix what exists
4. **Don't change patterns** - Follow existing codebase patterns
5. **Don't ignore tests** - They define expected behavior

## üìù Notes for Next Session

When starting the next session:

1. First check if changes were reverted: `git status`
2. If not reverted, restore ExecutionContext files
3. Focus on fixing, not removing
4. Use the test files as the source of truth for expected behavior
5. Make incremental progress - get compilation working first
6. Track progress using the metrics above

Remember: The goal is a WORKING, PRODUCTION-READY service, not a simplified prototype.
