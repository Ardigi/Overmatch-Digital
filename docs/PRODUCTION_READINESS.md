# Production Readiness Checklist

This document outlines all requirements for deploying the SOC Compliance Platform to production.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Actual Readiness: 40% Complete

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Kong Konnect Enterprise Gateway Required
**NO LOCAL KONG**: This platform requires Kong Konnect cloud gateway for production. Local Kong in docker-compose is NOT supported for enterprise deployment.

**UPDATED STATUS (August 14, 2025)**: Platform readiness increased to **40% production ready**. Policy Service now fully operational in Docker with infrastructure-level secrets management. Auth Service works, Frontend operational, but most services still need Docker deployment.

See [CURRENT_STATE.md](./CURRENT_STATE.md) for latest platform status.

## ‚úÖ Actually Completed (Verified - August 14, 2025)

### Infrastructure & Core Services
- [x] PostgreSQL database running
- [x] Redis cache running
- [x] Kafka message broker running
- [x] Elasticsearch running (optional)
- [x] MongoDB running (optional)
- [x] Keycloak running on port 8180
- [x] 12 service databases created
- [x] **Policy Service FULLY OPERATIONAL** in Docker (port 3003)
- [x] **Auth Service operational** (builds to dist/main.js)
- [x] **Control Service builds correctly** (0 TypeScript errors)
- [x] **Client Service builds correctly**
- [x] **Frontend operational** (Next.js running, connected to services)
- [x] **Secrets management migrated** to infrastructure level

## ‚ùå Not Complete (Updated - August 14, 2025)

### Services Need Docker Deployment
- [ ] **Auth Service**: Needs Docker deployment (code ready)
- [ ] **Client Service**: Needs Docker deployment (code ready)
- [ ] **Control Service**: Needs Docker deployment (code ready)
- [ ] **Evidence Service**: Needs Docker deployment (still uses SecretsModule)
- [ ] **Workflow Service**: Needs Docker deployment and testing
- [ ] **Reporting Service**: Needs Docker deployment and testing
- [ ] **Audit Service**: Needs Docker deployment and testing
- [ ] **Integration Service**: Needs Docker deployment and testing
- [ ] **Notification Service**: Needs Docker deployment and testing
- [ ] **AI Service**: Needs Docker deployment and testing

### Infrastructure Issues
- [x] **Kong Konnect**: Enterprise cloud gateway REQUIRED (local Kong NOT supported)
- [ ] **API Versioning**: All services need /api/v1 prefix for Konnect
- [ ] **Database Migrations**: Need compilation for production
- [ ] **E2E Tests**: Must test through Kong Konnect gateway only

### Remaining Security Tasks
- [x] **Secrets Management**: ‚úÖ Migrated to infrastructure level for Policy Service
- [ ] **Auth Service**: Still uses application-level SecretsModule
- [ ] **Evidence Service**: Still uses application-level SecretsModule
- [ ] **Production Secrets**: Need AWS Secrets Manager or Vault setup

## üî¥ Actual Status Summary (August 14, 2025)

### Platform Progress
| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Policy Service** | ‚úÖ Deployed to Docker | Running on port 3003, health endpoint working |
| **Auth Service** | ‚úÖ Code ready | Builds to dist/main.js, needs Docker deployment |
| **Client Service** | ‚úÖ Code ready | Builds correctly, needs Docker deployment |
| **Control Service** | ‚úÖ Code ready | 0 TypeScript errors, needs Docker deployment |
| **Other Services** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need testing | 7 services need Docker deployment and testing |
| **Secrets Management** | üîÑ Migrating | Policy Service done, Auth/Evidence still need migration |
| **Kong Konnect** | ‚úÖ REQUIRED | Enterprise cloud gateway (NO local Kong) |
| **Production Ready** | **40%** | 1 of 11 services deployed to Docker |

## üìã Required for Production (Actual List)

### Critical Fixes Needed
1. **Deploy remaining services** - 10 services need Docker deployment
2. **Fix Evidence Service** - Remove type safety violations
3. **Get all services integrated** - Need proper service-to-service communication
4. **Fix PowerShell scripts** - Some have syntax errors
5. **Complete secrets migration** - Auth and Evidence services need migration
6. **Fix secrets package** - Has build errors (or remove if migrated)

### Infrastructure Requirements
- [ ] Update all 11 services to use /api/v1 prefix
- [ ] Register all services with Kong Konnect
- [ ] Get all 11 microservices operational
- [ ] Fix service-to-service communication through Konnect
- [ ] Repair integration test infrastructure
- [x] Kong Konnect cloud gateway REQUIRED (not local Kong)
- [ ] Fix all migration scripts
- [ ] Complete secrets management migration
- [ ] Setup monitoring that works
- [ ] Create working CI/CD pipeline
